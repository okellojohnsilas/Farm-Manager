# FARM MANAGER
#### By **Okello John Silas**
#### This is a prototype design for a farm management application written in java based on JavaFx, Date of current version is 12/20/2019
## Description
The application is a simple prototype application that has few functionalities like add new animals, sell new animals, view animals and buy new animals.
The basis for storage is use of animal tag numbers that are unique tags given to animals on farms to identify them uniquely. For now the only animals it works with are cows, goats and sheep
